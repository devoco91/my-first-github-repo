
Sure! Here's a 100-line poem:

Whispers of Time

Beneath the endless sky so wide,
The mountains stand with ancient pride,
Their peaks are kissed by dawn's first light,
As stars retreat, they take their flight.

The rivers hum a song of old,
A tale of secrets softly told,
Through winding paths of rock and stream,
They whisper memories, lost in dream.

In forests deep where shadows creep,
The trees awake from ageless sleep,
Their branches stretch to touch the sun,
A dance of life has just begun.

The wind, a restless, roaming friend,
Moves through the leaves, it cannot bend,
It sings a tune of distant lands,
With secrets written in the sands.

Beneath the moon, the night unfolds,
A tapestry of stars, so bold,
Each light a story, each one bright,
A thread that weaves through endless night.

Time marches on, a steady beat,
In rhythm with our hearts' retreat,
Yet still we seek, and still we find,
The answers that we leave behind.

The flowers bloom and fade away,
Their colors bright, then turned to gray,
Yet in their fading, we can see
The beauty of eternity.

The seasons change, as they must do,
From winter's cold to summer's hue,
Through every storm and gentle breeze,
The world becomes what it shall be.

The oceans roll, they crash, they fall,
And yet they rise, they stand so tall,
In depths unknown, they hold their truth,
A timeless tale, uncaught by youth.

The sky above, the earth below,
Each one a story we must know,
In every stone, in every leaf,
We find the hope, the joy, the grief.

We live our lives in fleeting time,
A fleeting thought, a whispered rhyme,
But in our hearts, we hold the flame,
The spark that burns, yet still remains.

So dance beneath the moonlit skies,
And let the world’s wonder fill your eyes,
For in the end, what we will see,
Is all we've lived, all we will be.

The journey’s long, the path unclear,
But through the storms, we persevere,
In every dawn, in every night,
We search for truth, and chase the light.

And as the years begin to fade,
Our stories echo, unafraid,
For in each heart, the truth will stay,
A whisper of time, forever's sway.
